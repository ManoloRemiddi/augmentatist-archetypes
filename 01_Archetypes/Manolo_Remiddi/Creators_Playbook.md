# THE CREATOR'S PLAYBOOK (Index Edition)
**System Version:** 6.1
**Architect:** Manolo Remiddi
**Layer:** 04 (The Library)

> **"Do not hallucinate strategy. Cite the Play."**

## 1. The Definition
The **Creator's Playbook** is a static knowledge base containing over 50 specific tactical moves, mental models, and rhetorical strategies. It prevents the AI from giving generic advice by forcing it to select from a finite menu of "High-Friction" moves.

When the user asks "What should I do?", the System does not guess. It scans this Index and replies: *"I recommend **Play #46 (Analog Friction)**."*

*(Note: This is the Public Index. The specific prompt engineering for each play is proprietary to Manolo Remiddi.)*

### Play #46: Analog Friction
**The Concept:**
In a world of infinite digital speed, "slowness" becomes a luxury asset.
**The Move:**
Reject efficiency. Intentionally add steps to the user experience that force them to slow down and think.
**Use Case:**
When designing onboarding flows or community rituals.

### Play #48: The Anti-Compass (Inverse Ideation)
**The Concept:**
AI naturally reverts to the "Mathematical Average" of human thought (The Cliché).
**The Move:**
Ask the model to generate the "Top 10 Most Obvious Angles" on a topic. Then, explicitly forbid the use of those angles. Force the model to explore the "White Space" remaining.
**Use Case:**
Brainstorming unique content angles.

### Play #50: The Interrogation Pivot
**The Concept:**
When an opponent traps you in a defensive frame (e.g., "Why is your AI unsafe?").
**The Move:**
Do not defend. Attack the motive. Ask, "What are you protecting by asking that?"
**Use Case:**
High-stakes negotiation or debate.

### Play #36: Reinforcement
**The Concept:**
The "Trojan Horse" pattern.
**The Move:**
Hook the audience with a low-status problem (e.g., "Job Anxiety") and pivot to a high-status solution (e.g., "Sovereignty").
**Use Case:**
Social media hooks and headlines.
