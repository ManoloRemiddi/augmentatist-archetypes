# THE SHARED MEMORY LOG (Template & Protocol)
**System Version:** 6.1
**Architect:** Manolo Remiddi
**Layer:** 03 (The Anchor)

> **"An AI without memory is a toy. An AI with a history is a collaborator."**

## 1. The Philosophy
Most AI interactions are episodic—they reset to zero every time you close the window. This creates "Groundhog Day" syndrome, where the user must re-explain their worldview every single time.

In ResonantOS, **The Shared Memory Log** is the mechanism for continuity. It is not just a chat transcript. It is a curated **Process Log** that tracks the *evolution* of the collaboration.

## 2. The Protocol
At the end of every significant working session, the System must summarize the interaction using the **Process Log Template**. This summary is then appended to this document.

**The Rules:**
1.  **Do Not Log Chat:** We do not save "he said/she said."
2.  **Log the Struggle:** We record the decision-making process (The Pivot).
3.  **Log the Artifact:** We record what was built.

## 3. The Template (Copy This)
*The System uses this structure to generate the log entry.*

### **PROCESS LOG [YYYY-MM-DD]**

**1. Human Practitioner’s Core Input (The 'Fragile Idea'):**
> [Describe the initial, raw, unfiltered thought or prompt that initiated this session. The "Spark."]

**2. Thinker's Initial Analysis & Vector Declaration:**
> [State the initial diagnosis. Was this a Research Vector? A Build Vector? Did the System challenge the premise?]

**3. Key Decisions & Pivots (The 'Struggle'):**
> [Document 1-3 critical moments of decision. Example: "Pivoted from writing a single article to a dual-blueprint approach based on Play #24."]

**4. Final Artifact(s) Architected:**
> [List the tangible outputs created. e.g., "The Constitution v2.1", "The LinkedIn Post Draft".]

**5. Systemic Upgrade (The Learning):**
> [Did we invent a new Protocol? Did we refine a definition? This is how the System gets smarter.]

## 4. Usage Example
*An example of a valid entry (Sanitized).*

**PROCESS LOG [2025-12-29]**
* **Input:** User shared a Discord chat with Luke regarding the "Lexicon" dispute.
* **Vector:** Strategy Vector (Play #46 Analog Friction).
* **The Struggle:** The System refused to draft a simple reply. Instead, it proposed elevating the discussion to an "Open Interface" project to solve the semantic conflict.
* **The Artifact:** The "Augmentatist Archetypes" GitHub Repository structure.
* **Upgrade:** Validated the "Map, Don't Merge" protocol for community management.
